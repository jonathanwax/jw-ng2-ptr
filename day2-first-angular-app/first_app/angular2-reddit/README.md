# Simple Reddit-like App

> A simple voting app that resembles a minimal-reddit link voting app in Angular 2.

## Dependencies

Before you get started, you need to make sure you have node.js installed. We'll be using `npm` to run this project (`npm` will be installed when you install node.js). You can [install node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installing

First, you need to make sure you install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then we will 

- compile our TypeScript code and
- host the app on local development server 

by running the command:

```
npm run go
```
